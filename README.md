# Relocation Cost Predictor

The Relocation Cost Predictor is a Streamlit app that predicts the cost of relocating a house based on various factors such as the number of stairs, objects to dismantle and pack, distance to the moving vehicle, moving duration, number of movers, and effort level.

**Important Note:** This app is a proof of concept and is based on hypothetical values. The predictions generated by the app do not represent real-world relocation costs. It is intended for demonstrative purposes only and should not be used for actual relocation planning or budgeting.
## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting relocation details
- Real-time prediction of relocation cost
- Detailed cost breakdown and model performance metrics
- Visualization of feature importance

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app/relocation_cost_app.py

2. Open the app in your web browser using the provided URL.

3. Use the sidebar to input the relocation details such as the number of stairs, objects to dismantle and pack, distance to the moving vehicle, moving duration, number of movers, and effort level.

4. Click the "Predict" button to get the estimated relocation cost.

5. View the cost breakdown, model performance metrics, and feature importance visualization.

## Dataset

The relocation cost dataset used for training the model is located in the `data/` directory. You can replace the `relocation_cost_data.csv` file with your own dataset if desired.

## Model

The trained Random Forest Regressor model is saved as `relocation_cost_model.pkl` in the `models/` directory. If you want to retrain the model or use a different model, you can update the code in the `notebooks/relocation_cost_analysis.ipynb` notebook and save the new model.
